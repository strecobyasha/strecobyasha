### Hi everyone ðŸ‘‹

My name is Roman. I am a self-hosted developer. I tried java and mobile apps development, react and frontend things, but Python is what I really like.

- :musical_note: Iâ€™m currently try to break down songs into instruments (this is a sad story without machine learning...)
- :israel: Iâ€™m currently learning Hebrew (C++ in human languages).
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about everything.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I am a big fan of "Family Guy"
