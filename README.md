### Hi everyone 👋

My name is Roman. I am a self-hosted developer. I tried java and mobile apps development, react and frontend things, but Python is what I really like.

- :musical_note: I’m currently try to break down songs into instruments (this is a sad story without machine learning...)
- 💬 Ask me about everything.
- :israel: I’m currently learning Hebrew (C++ in human languages).
- ⚡ Fun fact: I like striped t-shirts.
